# pusl3120-assessment-template

This is the template for your Pusl3120 Assessment. It uses a single repo.

Refer to the brief document for details regarding what is required.

It also contains a .gitignore file, which should prevent unnecessary (temporary) files being committed (specific to Node.js, which is required).

The top level should have a single compose file, and separate directories for each application / component / container.
